						<h2>Face Recognition App</h2>
					</a>
					<h3>React and Express.js</h3>
					<hr>
					<blockquote>Submit pictures and let the app recognize all the faces for you!</blockquote>
					<hr>
					<p>This is a project including front-end creating by React, with the face recognition function provided by Clarifai API, and a back-end server to handle all the request. Also, there is a database to store user information.<br>
					I also made sure to add the profile page where user information could be edited, and taking different input scenery in consideration so there would be popup messages giving hints when a submission is done.</p>

						<h2>Robot Friend</h2>
					</a>
					<h3>React</h3>
					<hr>
					<blockquote>Search your robots and create new ones! Let your imagination go wild!</blockquote>
					<hr>
					<p>This is a project created with Create React App, featuring a real time search result while you type. There is also a 'NEW' section on the top right corner, where you could customize your own robot, preview its profile, and add to your list if you want! More over, if you don't have a clear idea in mind for your robot, you can use the 'random' button to generate a robot automatically!<br>
					Note that there is no database in this project, so any changes made on the list would not be saved.</p>

						<h2>Letter Generator</h2>
					</a>
					<h3>Vanilla HTML, CSS , and Javascript</h3>
					<hr>
					<blockquote>Generate your own letter with a few simple steps. There is also a bonus section where you could get quotes of the day. Now go pick a piece of paper and start writing!</blockquote>
					<hr>
					<p>In the project, I aimed to build a website with clear sections and easy navigaiton. You could skip to different parts by the Navigation Bar, the 'NEXT' button, or the Back-To-Top button.<br> I also wanted to make it interactive and customized, so I designed multiple functional sections where data are collected to create a personalized output. Moreover, there is a bonus section to automatically generate a quote of the day.</p>
